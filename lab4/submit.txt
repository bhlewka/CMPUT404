1. https://github.com/bhlewka/CMPUT404/tree/master/lab4/mysite

2. the install successfully worked! little rocket ship thingy

3. / is a 404 page not found, different from the assignment 1 page, polls is some hellow world text

4. they are changes we make to our database schematic, mostly automatic, according to google

5. we see an admin page that lets us edit our db, we can access more by adding them to the admin.py page

6. we see "question 38", this goes on ad infinitum

7. when they change we will have to manually change them in all the templates instead of them doing so dynamically

8. a generic view is quick, easy, and convenient for static pages, so you wouldn't want to use it when your page has dynamic changes
